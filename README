Analysis corresponding to paper "Scalable Bayesian inference for self-excitatory processes applied to big American gunfire data" (2020) by Holbrook, Loeffler, Flaxman and Suchard.

Scripts guide:

combine_and_thin_data.R: merges two D.C. shotspotter datasets to create comprehensive data, and thins data to check check how results change with changing temporal precision.
combine_and_data.R: same as above but without thinning.
RvsC.R: compares compute times for single-core, unvectorized C++ vs naive R.
get_probs_se.R: computes posterior probabilities that individual events are self-excitatory in nature.
individual_se_probs_fig.R: creates density plot for the above for a handful of events.
lengthscale_images.R: posterior density plots for various model parameters.
make_prob_se_data.R: merges posterior probabilities self-excitatory with spatiotemporal data.
*run.R: different MCMC runs for different data settings.
performFigure.R: creates figure comparing performance of GPU and multi-core/vectorized CPU.
timeByNFigure.R: creates figure comparing performance of GPU and multi-core/vectorized CPU.
utils.R: helper functions for processing of lat-lon data.
